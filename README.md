# Blogick

Compiler’s Design class project: Developed our own language baptized as “Blogick” in a team of two people by creating a compiler and a virtual machine with Python and the library “PLY”. Created a drag and drop blocks interface using Blockly (Google Developers tool) which were later translated to the “Blogick” language to finally be compiled. All of this, to help people learn the programming logic easier.
